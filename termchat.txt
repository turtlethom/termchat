Network Communication
> Sockets: The foundation of network communication. Think of them as virtual phone lines between computers.
> IP + Port: One machine acts as the "server" (listener), the other as the "client" (connector).
Concurrency
> Threading: You need one thread to send messages and another to receive messages simultaneously.
Data Flow
> Serialization: Convert messages to bytes for transmission.
> Encryption (Optional): Scramble data so only the intended recipient can read it.
User Interface
> Terminal I/O: Non-blocking input/output so typing isn't interrupted by incoming messages.
